A Discord & Twitch Bot that pulls information from several APIs and includes a wide range of commands.

## Installation

1. [Remix](https://glitch.com/edit/?utm_content=project_fnapibot&utm_source=remix_this&utm_medium=button&utm_campaign=glitchButton#!/remix/fnapibot) this project.
2. Make [FortniteTracker.com](https://fortnitetracker.com/site-api) and [FortniteAPI.io](https://fortniteapi.io/) API keys.
3. Create a [Discord App](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and link a Bot to it.
4. Edit your .env file with your Discord Bot token and API keys.
5. Copy your Client ID from Discord and paste it [here](https://scarsz.me/authorize) to add your Bot to a Server.

## Usage

- For a list of commands, type `s.help` inside a Discord channel where the bot is in.
- Some commands are simple, some are not.
- BenBot Documentation can be found [here](https://benbotfn.tk/). If you are confused about which parameters are available, look there.
- Fortnite-API.com Documentation can be found [here](https://dash.fortnite-api.com/).
- FortniteAPI.io Documentation can be found [here](https://fortniteapi.io/).
